To confirm an incoming request, OpenStack Identity validates a set of credentials users supply. Initially, these credentials are a user name and password, or a user name and API key. When OpenStack Identity validates user credentials, it issues an authentication token. Users provide the token in subsequent requests. Credentials Data that confirms the identity of the user. For example, user name and password, user name and API key, or an authentication token that the Identity service provides. Domain An Identity service API v3 entity. Domains are a collection of projects and users that define administrative boundaries for managing Identity entities. Domains can represent an individual, company, or operator-owned space. They expose administrative activities directly to system users. Users can be granted the administrator role for a domain. A domain administrator can create projects, users, and groups in a domain and assign roles to users and groups in a domain. Endpoint A network-accessible address, usually a URL, through which you can access a service. If you are using an extension for templates, you can create an endpoint template that represents the templates of all consumable services that are available across the regions. Group An Identity service API v3 entity. Groups are a collection of users owned by a domain. A group role, granted to a domain or project, applies to all users in the group. Adding or removing users to or from a group grants or revokes their role and authentication to the associated domain or project. OpenStackClient A command-line interface for several OpenStack services including the Identity API. For example, a user can run the openstack service create and openstack endpoint create commands to register services in their OpenStack installation. Project A container that groups or isolates resources or identity objects. Depending on the service operator, a project might map to a customer, account, organization, or tenant. Region An Identity service API v3 entity. Represents a general division in an OpenStack deployment. You can associate zero or more sub-regions with a region to make a tree-like structured hierarchy. Although a region does not have a geographical connotation, a deployment can use a geographical name for a region, such as us-east . Role A personality with a defined set of user rights and privileges to perform a specific set of operations. The Identity service issues a token to a user that includes a list of roles. When a user calls a service, that service interprets the user role set, and determines to which operations or resources each role grants access. Service An OpenStack service, such as Compute (nova), Object Storage (swift), or Image service (glance), that provides one or more endpoints through which users can access resources and perform operations. Token An alpha-numeric text string that enables access to OpenStack APIs and resources. A token may be revoked at any time and is valid for a finite duration. While OpenStack Identity supports token-based authentication in this release, it intends to support additional protocols in the future. OpenStack Identity is an integration service that does not aspire to be a full-fledged identity store and management solution. User A digital representation of a person, system, or service that uses OpenStack cloud services. The Identity service validates that incoming requests are made by the user who claims to be making the call. Users have a login and can access resources by using assigned tokens. Users can be directly assigned to a particular project and behave as if they are contained in that project.","title":"Openstack Keystone"},{"location":"Openstack/Openstack Keystone/#openstack-keystone","text":"","title":"Openstack Keystone"},{"location":"Openstack/Openstack Keystone/#identity-concepts","text":"","title":"Identity concepts"},{"location":"Openstack/Openstack Keystone/#authentication","text":"The process of confirming the identity of a user.
